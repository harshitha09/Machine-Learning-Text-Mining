Would PEP want all sales teams interpreting social media and interpret growth opportunities or would/should this be managed by a specific group only?  Business process should drive this functinality 
"Would like a deeper dive to better understand the Jams (internal) vs Social (external) and how to build out communications with Third Party Distributors, Customers, etc.  It was a bit confussing and not sure if security measures would exit (confidenciatlity)"
when will the tool allow the user to see who reviewed the shared documents and take it to another level of which portion of the document was reviewed?
Very strong in collaboration. Wish they had not focused on it as much as they did. 
Very cool mapping and analytical functionality
Very capable platform for collabration.  Sure we will have to change with the trend and move away from email to more of a chatter way but the increased visability and transpaency.
"Vendor showed great ways to connect and callaborate between customer and sales rep, between FSR/KAM to PSAM/PD"
Utilization of group collaboration for external communication and fobos
This would not be a big portion of time for the PWS CM's.  Could be useful to get quick insight into consumers perspective
This will be down the road for us to work into but again with it being Microsofta and having BING as a search engine
This was similar for all compaines presenting.  
Their collaboration platform seemed a little confusing to follow.  Specifically when they discussed the value of Chatter vs. normal emails.
"The visualization around the Social Media were similar, but their approach as leveraging for an opportunity finder or prioritization into the Selling/TPM was effective."
"the surfbi ui seemed very robust and they presented a good story in how to use. As pointed out, this in not an oracle tool and they have not developed their own tool kit with native integration. Hard to get excited about their showing a 3rd party front end as having advanced capabilities on siebel software"
The only presentation that had an answer for external communication and fobo alignment.  
"The Marketing Cloud was impressive, alowing trending topics, promotions, local events for opportunities.    Would like to see how to access the information in a demo vs ppt snapshots"
The ability to collaborate and to share best practice and the ability to cross share the info accross as many or as few as you like.
"Some of their social net working capabilities were insightful, but I'm unclear how it would be value added to our frontline sales teams."
"Social was good, and all ofOracles purchased solutions are not integrated to each other."
"Similar to other users,  business needs to define usage."
"Showed a system that allows for RSS feeds and has a twitter like feed to share comments and documents across.  Appeared user friendly, etc."
"Share of voice, Sentiment break down, Competative, Brand/Package, etc. all avaialble with charting capability is very powerful"
"Seemed to be relatively simple....not terribly robust, but not sure our needs for these features are high priority"
Saw very basic discussion functionality on customer comments.  Good integration into Outlook and ability to put the data where the user desires.  
same comments as #9
Same comment as before.
Same as above.
rely on 3rd party. integration options are strong and relatively open. 
relied on 3rd party data feeds. showed strong experience and skills from other implementations . Accenture has been very active in this space for several years and actively staffing expertise
Real time back and forth was great.  Didn't see a lot on social media.
Pepsico one touch is an interesting idea and I would be interested in learning more.
Not sure how I will apply this fully to my job duties.
Need to understand how PEP looks to integrate this functionality int business processes.  Can become content overload.
Need to make sure the IRI and Customers data can be acessed
Need the ability to access IRI data to leverage Catagory and social insights
MS Collaboration is via outlook and Lync. However outlook collaboration is not available on the ipad
Most Collaboration is linked via outlook but there is no outlook app available for the iPad
"More focus on their integration capaiblties, not on the tools themselves.  "
"Many existing platforms, expanded to meet increased needs"
"Made it clear that capability was there, usage would depend on future need.  Clearly built into software "
"Look its Microsoft tell me how they could fail,  I think this is a very strong part of what they will offer us"
Liked how the vendor was able to pull the information into the applacation and feed that info into real selling conversations
Like the integrated system and would help save time for the CM 
leverage their existing software
It seemed to me that they would support the enhancement of what we already have in place....but I didn't gather that they were purposing any innovative idease regarding social media.
Internal only cant currently involve the customer
Integration with TPM would be a plus here on the retail side.  Social networking was a plus.
Integration with Outlook and Office gives an edge over other vendors from collaboration standpoint.
Incremental cost associated with external users.
"I'm very hesitant to support the social media aspect at certain levels due to it's potential lack of credibility.  SM tends to be ""trendy"" and has a ""blog"" feel to it.  I would not present SM data unless I could confirm it was consistent with IRI/Consumer insights/share data."
HTe Chatter function needs to be broken out and kept as groups. Opening it up to the masses may be too much and too wide spread. We need filters for data and communication
Great uses but again this will be something we can move to in time to help the sales process
Great collaboration built in
Great access to customer centric insights.
"Good capabilities, but not necessarily value added to the target audience.."
"giving high marks on modeling and analytics because of their analytic tools. Social media integration seems, again, to be a portal to data collected from other systems (other than core Oracle) and simply displayed rather than analyzed and reacted to"
Gettting conected to the outside world IE FOBOs was not clear
Functionality appeared to be available but a more streamlined demonstration would be helpful.   
"From what I can tell, they were just selling integration services for other vendors.  They really did not present any real tools, just services to manage the data.  "
"From a crawl to walk perspective the current collaboration functionality of Internal users/groups only is sufficient.  Oracle roadmap to offer external will be availale should we want to run and open up communications/collaboration with Customers, Distributors, Vendors, etc.  "
Fantastic job with Shopper insights.
external audience participation does not exist currently but is in the roadmap for a later release
equal to other vendors
Didn't see anything social media related.
"Didn't quite understand the collaboration with customers, or how to connect internally to other divisions via retail accounts"
Did not support collaboration outside of PepsiCo. Was unclear what that user experience would be in future releases.
Did not see much in the demo that highlighted this capability.   Most of the analytics were simple reports....not true insights
Did not see any discussions in this area.  
did not provide enough information on social media.
"Crawl, Walk and Run approach was easy to follow with regards to what we can do in the short term vs. what does the future look like."
Cost to include FOBO or external customers
Concern about the lack of current integration into MS Lync and the confusion that will create within the organization.  
Collaboration was largely a function of integrating other vendor solutions 
"Clearly the best piece of their presentation.  Their social media gathering, etc was pretty amazing.  "
"Chatter was clearly this vendors differenciation.  However, i'm not sure PEP organizationally is ready to take the plung with communicating with both internal/external parties, search/read or ask for content, etc.  "
As disscussed Pepsi has this capabilities and should be first looked as the place to go for this content.  The value is when you are able to bring that real time to the customer.
Appeared to exist but would like to see CPG-Beverage (Foodservice) specifics.    
analytics based on social media discussions was powerful and interesting
Again...the vendor has a unique view from the inside our company and showed what ways that they can help us.
Accenture does not have a collaboration tool
"1.At store level management was great. 2. Social media was good, not sure how to apply to my day to day functions"
1. Tied in how information would relate to my day to day slaes call.
1. Spending too much time on IM program.(Chatter)
